# React Native & Microsoft Weekly Sync : December 5, 2019

We are slowly getting into a rhythm for the weekly syncs. Some of the key topics that came up this week include the following:

## New features, breaking changes
[Pressable](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commits?author=yungsters&since=2019-11-27&until=2019-12-05) is coming soon! No breaking changes of note at this time. 

## High quality community modules
As a corollary to the discussions around [what packages belong in react-native-community](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/176), there is a need to surface principles, best practices and even tooling for how customers of react-native can navigate the ecosystem and identify high quality, trustworthy, well maintained, cross-platform modules for their app needs. We had a good conversation on this topic with representatives from [Expo](https://expo.io/), Facebook and Microsoft. A proposal is being drafted including inputs from the discussions thread and will be shared in this repo in the New Year to take the discussion forward with the community. 

## API documentation
A few folks from Microsoft and Facebook have been tagged to collaborate on figuring out code-generated API stubs for a more thorough API documentation for react-native core as well as platform specific APIs. We will share more of our plans and timelines in this area in the New Year. 

## "Things you don't like about React Native"
A post has been a bit overdue to collate and respond to the most recent thread on [Things you don't like about React Native](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/134). We will be collaborating on publishing a response in the New Year. Stay tuned!
