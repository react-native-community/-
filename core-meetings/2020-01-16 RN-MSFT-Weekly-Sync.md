# React Native & Microsoft Weekly Sync : January 16, 2020

After a short break during the holiday season, we are back to business in 2020. 

## Open source collaboration

In an attempt to run more of our collaboration in the open and have the rest of the community participate in more of the conversations, we are trying out a few tracks:

### 1. Discussions in the open:
You might have noticed a flurry of activity in the Issues section of this repo in the last couple of weeks. At this time, almost all the internal discussion topics that we are collaborating on have been filed as [Issues](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues). This is being done to ensure a broader perspective on topics and to solicit feedback from the core contributors as well as wider community members as we work to evolve the React Native framework. Keeping discussions in the github repo allows for a consistent, persistent and singular source of truth across all collaborators. **Please participate in the issues and give us any feedback you see fit**.

### 2. Project management in the open:
We have moved all internal workstreams and individual work items to this github. You can now track our progress the same way we will be managing our collaboration : through the [FB â€“ MSFT Collaboration Project board](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/projects/1)

### 3. Triage and Issue management in the open:
We will shortly be kicking off triage sessions with select stakeholders from each of our companies as well as core-contributors, other collaborators etc., for managing issues across several core React Native repos and expect to post processes/triage notes etc., as we go along. 

With these processes in place, these weekly notes will likely become a bit lighter as folks can follow along using the various sources above. We will capture any outliers as well as general topics in these notes going forward.
